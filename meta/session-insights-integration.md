# Session Insights Integration - Future Ideas

## Problem
How to systematically incorporate new insights from `.claude-code-sessions/` files into our memory system.

## Explored Options

### Option 1: Manual Review Process
- Periodic review of session files for new patterns/learnings
- Update memory files when we spot valuable insights
- **Pros**: Simple, human oversight
- **Cons**: Requires discipline, may miss insights

### Option 2: Automated Insight Extraction
- Script analyzes session files for key patterns:
  - New error messages and solutions
  - Environment setup discoveries
  - Code patterns that worked well
  - Process improvements
- Generates suggested updates to memory files
- **Pros**: Systematic, catches patterns
- **Cons**: May miss nuanced insights

### Option 3: Session-to-Memory Pipeline
- Post-session script asks: "What did we learn?"
- Extracts specific insights and suggests memory updates
- Could integrate with git hooks when session files are committed
- **Pros**: Real-time capture
- **Cons**: Interrupts workflow

### Option 4: AI-Assisted Review
- Script uses Claude to analyze session files
- Identifies new insights not already captured in memory
- Generates diff suggestions for memory files
- **Pros**: Understands context and nuance
- **Cons**: Requires API access, may be overkill

## Recommended Approach
Combination of **Option 2 + 4**:
1. Automated pattern detection for common insight types
2. AI analysis for novel learnings identification
3. Generate suggested memory file updates
4. Human approval of changes

## Implementation Ideas
- Parse session files for error/solution patterns
- Detect environment setup discoveries
- Identify successful code patterns
- Use Claude API to analyze for novel insights
- Generate diffs for memory file updates
- Present suggestions for human review

## Status
Exploration complete - out of scope for current implementation.
