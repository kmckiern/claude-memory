1. I've been using claude code to do the last couple PRs in both these repositories. Please read the CLAUDE.md files in both, and also read the .claude-code-session files in each repository. Tell me what you learned. write your results into analysis.md

2. Okay, good. Now our goal is to factor out these insights into a better memory system. And I think we can have a global file for shared concepts and process information, etc. And then a repo-specific version, and that should have sort of like a common template or format. And we can factor out these two repos into that file.
